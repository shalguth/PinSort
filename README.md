# PinSort

App grabs my 50 most recent pins and displays them.
There's an added option to sort the images based on color.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Before pin sorting -
![Before](public/before.png?raw=true "Before sorting")

## After pin sorting -
